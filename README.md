# Singular Spectrum Analysis

Based on the code: https://github.com/aj-cloete/pySSA

Main differences:
- removed support for missing values
- removed forcasting (it can be easily added if needed)
- restructured the code to be more readable and it now runs as a function i.e. no object oriented code
- add multi-scale SSA
